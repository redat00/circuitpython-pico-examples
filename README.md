Simple examples on how to get started with CircuitPython using a Raspberry Pico! 

## Installation of CircuitPython

To install CircuitPython on your Raspberry Pico, you should visit the official CircuitPython website, where you'll be able to find an official firmware compiled for your Pico! 

[Official CircuitPython Pico page](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/)

In ordre to install this firmware you will have to do the following : 

* Press the button on the Pico

* Connect it to your computer while holding the button down, after you've connected it you can release the button. 

* A device should have appeared on your computer, just like if you've connected an USB stick, just copy/paste your firmware (.uf2 file) onto the Pico.

* Pico will automatically reboot, and will again pop-up similarly as USB stick. You can now directly code on it by editing code.py or you can access it by REPL.
